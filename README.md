# **Ray Tracing Image Generator - Andrzej Wrzesinski**

The project consisted in implementing a program that generates an image in JPEG format, showing a set of spheres,
imitating different types of materials: glass, dielectric or metal. The creation of imitations of these solids was created using the Ray Tracing method.
The final image consists of 3 main spheres, along with many other smaller ones. The image is generated in the standard aspect ratio of 9 : 16,
for a width of 500px.
